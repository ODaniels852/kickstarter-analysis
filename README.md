# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns


**Overview of the Project**
An up-and-coming playwright, Louise, wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her US play, Fever. She’s estimated a budget of over $10k but has requested my assistance in analyzing crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful. Analysis results will be provided to Louise to help her plan her own efforts to ensure a successful campaign.

**Analysis and Challenges**
Analysis consisted of the review of Kickstarter crowdfunding data for 4114 campaigns; 3038 of which were in the US.  Data was originally represented with parent and subcategory classifications combined; these categories were separated to allow for more detailed analysis of data most relevant to Louise’s campaign.

Review of US campaigns revealed that, in the parent category, theater campaigns were among the most successful, followed by musicals. Also in the US, in the subcategory, plays were by far the most successful campaign. However, although theater and play campaigns were highly successful, there were several campaigns in these categories that were unsuccessful as well; therefore, additional factors needed to be reviewed to better understand attributes of successful campaigns.

Campaign launch dates within the data were converted to a more readable format; then US campaign outcomes for the subcategory of plays was compared by launch month to determine any successful trends. The months that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns were May and June.

A review of statical goal and pledge data for US play campaigns revealed that failed campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful campaigns. The average goal for the 412 successful US play campaigns was $5,049; while the average goal for the 250 failed US play campaigns was $10,554. Pledge data also revealed that that failed US play campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money, because, the mean and median pledged amounts failed campaigns ($559 and $103 respectively), are much lower than the mean and median pledged amounts of successful play campaigns ($5,602 and $3,168 respectively).
 
**Results**
Based on my findings I would recommend that Louise kick off her campaign in May or June with a fundraising goal of closer to $5,000. Additionally, statistical review of musical data in Great Britain showed that Louise should attempt to get her future play there produced for around $2,000 instead of $4,000.
